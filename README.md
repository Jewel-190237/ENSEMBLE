n the realm of software development
and maintenance, the manual linking of
software feature documents to code com-
ponents is a critical yet challenging task
for developers. This linkage is essential
for various purposes such as implement-
ing new features, documentation, track-
ing, and test case design. Additionally,
it plays a pivotal role in third-party in-
spections to ensure compliance with regu-
lations governing different software prod-
ucts. However, the manual linking pro-
cess is fraught with challenges, including
errors and time constraints. To address
these challenges, previous studies have pro-
posed automated techniques. Despite their
potential benefits, these techniques often
encounter issues related to accuracy, cost,
and explainability. In response to these
limitations, our work is dedicated to ad-
dressing three crucial dimensions: accu-
racy, cost-effectiveness, and overall perfor-
mance. Our proposed solution involves an
innovative ensemble approach designed to
simultaneously improve accuracy and re-
duce costs. Through a series of exten-
sive experiments conducted on two distinct
software projects, we observed a notewor-
thy performance enhancement when link-
ing software features to three fundamen-
tal architectural abstractions of code com-
ponents: modules, classes, and methods.
Comparing our ENSEMBLE approach to
baseline lightweight techniques such as the
Vector Space Model (VSM), Latent Seman-
tic Indexing (LSI), and A Contextual The-
matic Approach for Linking Features to
Muilti-level Software Architectural Com-
ponent (FSECAM), our approach demon-
strated superior results. The evaluation, en-
compassing datasets from 18 cases across
the two projects, showcased higher preci-
sion rates, recall, and F1 scores, particu-
larly in the context of Modules and Classes
within proprietary projects. Out of the
18 cases evaluated, our proposed ENSEM-
BLE approach exhibited superior results in
14 cases, underscoring its effectiveness in
enhancing the linking of software feature
documents to code components. This re-
search contributes valuable insights into the
realm of automated techniques for linking
software documentation to code, address-
ing key challenges, and paving the way
for more accurate, cost-effective, and effi-
cient practices in software development and
maintenance.
